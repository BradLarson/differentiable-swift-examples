# Sharp edges in differentiable Swift

Since the deprecation of Swift for TensorFlow Differentiable Swift has come an even longer way in terms of usability.

Inspired by the original (and since out of date) [Swift for TensorFlow article](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/tutorials/Swift_autodiff_sharp_edges)
